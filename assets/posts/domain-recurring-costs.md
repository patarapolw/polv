I have just registered a domain with [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/). Although with some costs ([$10-35 USD annually](https://resources.banknovo.com/how-to-register-a-domain-name-for-your-business/)), and some difficulties, I am quite glad I chose this one.

Looking back, some alternatives I might choose next time includes [DreamHost](https://www.dreamhost.com/), [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/); but there are some limitations for domain name for the cheapest tier...
