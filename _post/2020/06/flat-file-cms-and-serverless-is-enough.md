This also obliviate the need to monitor your own database or entrust a third party to do it for you.

Still, you might need some functions you cannot rely on clients' web browser, such as [adding search](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-search/). Downloading indexes to client's machine is expensive and bad for SEO.

So, I use [lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/guides/searching.html) instead.

I built two essential files on the fly, before starting up a Nuxt server.

- `db.json` created by `JSON.string(glob)`
- `idx.json` created by `JSON.stringify(lunr)`

See,

Do you know that you can rollup a temporary server, potentially needed by `gatsby build` or `nuxt generate`? Such solutions are

I still have an editor / CMS, though; but it specifically targets a flat file folder,

Did I mentioned that I think [I was wrong in thinking that I need a CMS](https://dev.to/patarapolw/comment/pljm)? The truth is I still need a CMS, but I don't want to monitor a database.

One more thing I need is commenting engine. Indeed, an option is just use Disqus, but in the end, I hosted by own using Remark42, with [a little tweak to make it work with SPA](https://github.com/umputun/remark42/pull/723).
