Of course, I did start much of my journey with Python, but now I started to prefer TypeScript and Kotlin to Python. Also, I am very critical with Python, so I asked on Quora. (Please read the chat in comment sections of the answer as well.)

> Python applications. so they aremâ€™t C/C++ bindings (that implies the bindings are for C/C++ programs) - they are Python bindings for libraries written in C/C++.
>
> For computationally heavy functions such as numpy, then C/C++ is much better than Python - so people write computationally heavy functionality in C/C++ and then either write a Python layer as a binding wrapper, or write their C/C++ code so that it exposes a Python CAPI interface (allowing the library to be imported directly to a Python application).

> > Because Python is very easy to use, and a lot of developers are already using Python. Python has a massive choice of libraries and frameworks already developed. well over 200 in the standard library, and 200,000 in pypi ; all free of charge.
