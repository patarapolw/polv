This is possible with pre-install script to check for `yarn.lock` and `package.json`.

The closest I can find for this is,

Now, I did [ask the author to make CLI](https://github.com/sindresorhus/is-npm/issues/11) for me, but he didn't do exactly what I needed, so I made one myself.

Now, there is still an extra step. `"preinstall": "npx check-npm-yarn"` alone might not be enough. To avoid `npx` and installing every time, I make it,

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "preinstall": "if command -v check-npm-yarn > /dev/null; then check-npm-yarn; fi"
  }
}
```

I created `nsi` script for this.

```sh
nsi packageA packageB packageC ...
// Or nsi packageA packageB packageC ... --dev
```
