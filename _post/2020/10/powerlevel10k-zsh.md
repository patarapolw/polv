So, if you use zsh, don't just try `random` theme. `powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k` is not in there.

## What is powerlevel10k?

Powerlevel10k is a highly customizable theme, for CLI environment, zsh specifically. (I do realize about [oh-my-bash](https://ohmybash.nntoan.com/), but I haven't looked into it much.)

CLI is all text, but when you have [a right font](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#meslo-nerd-font-patched-for-powerlevel10k) and a good color palette, it is very powerful.
