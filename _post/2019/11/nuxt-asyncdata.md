Nuxt.js is a framework for making JavaScript apps a more static site, that is, pushing more to Server-Side Rendering, making it easier to web crawlers.

However, when it is made more static, reactivity is sacrificed.

So, I use `asyncData` to create teasers, and AJAX (fetch) to get more data, as can be seen on how this blog was made.

Indeed, the point of Nuxt.js is SEO. It might also be a little about security, with [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/).
