I find that the issue may includes:-

- Module dependencies
  - This can be solved by using virtualenv since the very beginning of the project
- Different python version
  - This can be managed very beautifully with tox
- Requiring something else outside the first two. For example, `brew install phantomjs`
  - I don't yet know how to manage this one...
  - Perhaps Docker
